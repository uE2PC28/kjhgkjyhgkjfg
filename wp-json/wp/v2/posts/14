For those who love listening to music, watching movies, and playing competitive online games on their device, it&#8217;s important to pay attention to the audio and sound quality.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class='aligncenter' style='display: block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;' src=\"https:\/\/www.brother2brother.co.uk\/images\/black-sharks-in-paris-backpack-p17904-46152_image.jpg\" width=\"301px\" alt=\"black shark 4 pros and cons\"\/><\/p>\n<p>With a higher sampling rate, tabs, flicks, and movements are registered faster and more frequently than ever. In addition, the Black Shark 4 Pro also supports three custom screen refresh rates among 60Hz, 90Hz, and 144Hz. Users can choose the appropriate screen refresh rate according to their personal preferences and different scenarios. 2.76mm ultra-small punch hole, 100% DCI-P3 color gamut, HDR10+, and MEMC motion compensation make this display pleasing to the eye.<\/p>\n<p>It\u2019s a little hard to recognize at first because the phone employs a sort of faux-futuristic gaming aesthetic. The device\u2019s AI assistant is an anime character that struck me as odd at first, but it never obscured anything important. The gamer-ish look and feel is great for a small <a href=\"https:\/\/dalaanresort.in\/sph-l720t-firmware-5-0-1-android-everything-you\/\">stock ROM firmware<\/a> audience, but others may be looking for something that just isn\u2019t quite awkward to be caught with in public. You may need to do some work on removing some of these visual tweaks. Plus, you\u2019re stuck with Android 11 instead of the more recent Android 12 for now and so far, there\u2019s been no word on how many Android versions or security updates you will receive.<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>You definitely have a lot of screen real estate to work with here.<\/li>\n<li>If you are having problems with system and apps your Xiaomi Black Shark 4 Pro you can use many advanced options or install a Stock ROM with bootloader mode.<\/li>\n<li>Things like shoulder buttons, colour-shifting LED lights on the back and a highly efficient internal cooling system will almost certainly be there, as well as Qualcomm&#8217;s latest top-of-the-range processor.<\/li>\n<li>An eye-watering 144Hz refresh rate and a touch sampling rate of up to 720Hz gives Black Shark 4 the industry&#8217;s lowest touch delay of just 8.3ms for smoother, more responsive gaming.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>In addition to the shoulder buttons, these phones still have a pressure-sensitive display that I really liked in the Black Shark 2. With the shoulder buttons and a screen like this, you can re-map the controls of a mobile game to be a little more comfortable. Richard Taylor is a technology expert and journalist based in the UK.

The Li-Po 4500 mAh, non-removable battery gives the smartphone a good battery backup.<\/p>\n<p>As for video, it is technically capable of shooting 4K, but really, you already  know where this is going. There is one saving grace, which is Xiaomi\u2019s redonkulously fast 120W Hyper Charge technology. You get the plug in the box and you can juice this phone back up to 100% in just 18 minutes in my testing. For a laugh, I also compared this with the OnePlus 10 Pro\u2019s Snapdragon 8 Gen 1 (3,682 multi-core)  and at the moment, the 4 Pro is beating this.<\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Additionally, we provide interesting benchmark data from trusted sources.
