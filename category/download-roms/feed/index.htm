										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Installing a custom ROM requires you to&nbsp;unlock the bootloader&nbsp;first,  and have a custom recovery like TWRP (website)&nbsp;installed. Make sure to always&nbsp;create a backup of your Android device&nbsp;before proceeding. While the download link for officially supported devices is mentioned below, some of <a href="https://chiasecungco.com/mastering-samsung-s6-edge-plus-download-a-guide-to/">https://chiasecungco.com/mastering-samsung-s6-edge-plus-download-a-guide-to/</a> these ROMs may have an unofficial port available for other devices as well. All you have to do is simply download the below-given Tecno CF7s firmware files and tools on your PC.</p>
<ul>
<li>You may also try this video tutorial if you have any confusion which uses a different method.</li>
<li>Download OxygenOS 12 H.38 for the OnePlus 7 Series from below.</li>
<li>Similarly, there is no such update as of now for the Android 11!</li>
<li>This guide is going to teach you how to Root Xiaomi Mi A3 using both methods.</li>
<li>For your sake, I have cherry-picked the best custom ROMs for Android above.</li>
</ul>
<p>Interested users can head to the official Carbon ROM site to get their hands on the custom ROM on their devices. Apart from these, it appears that a user has also managed to install an unofficial LineageOS 18.0 build which is based on Android 11 on their Samsung Galaxy S2. While these custom ROMs are still in the early stages of development, it is good to see that modders and developers are already working on providing Android 11 support to older devices. Nevertheless, custom ROMs like Potato Open Sauce Project (POSP) and ReloadedOS are already offering Android 11 support albeit unofficially.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class='aligncenter' style='display: block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;' src="https://image.winudf.com/v2/image/ZW11Lm5lcy5zbmVzLmdiYS5hcmNhZGUubjY0LnNpeF9zY3JlZW5fMl8xNTI4NzYyNDk2XzAyMA/screen-2.jpg" width="303px" alt="realme 5 pro stock rom android 11"/></p>
<p>I have personally tested almost all  the ROMs listed below on my Redmi K20 Pro, Poco F1, and Mi A1. Also, if you like the custom ROM, consider donating the developer behind the work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Redmi Note 8, as well as its younger brother Redmi Note 8T, have been supported by generic AOSP ROM with Android 11 (generic here i.e. the same ROM is valid for installation on both).</li>
<li>The update introduces a plethora of new features like a redesigned weather user interface, dark mode, Zen mode, Always-on ambient display, game space, and more.</li>
<li>So, if youâ€™re eagerly waiting for the Android 11 Custom Firmware to install on your device before anyone else, then check out some of the popular Custom ROMs below based on Android R.</li>
<li>It is nothing but a list of Google applications that come pre-installed with each Android device.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is based on &nbsp;AOSP and provides very close to Pixel look and feel. This Havoc OS ROM is material design-focused, fully-featured yet simple to use. There are tons of Customization features added to the ROM, from the status bar to quick setting, you can literally change anything.</p>
