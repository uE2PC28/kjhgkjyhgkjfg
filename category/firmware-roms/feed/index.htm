										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just remember that in most cases, flashing a factory image will completely wipe your phone. As time-consuming and boring it could be, preparing beforehand and backing up will&nbsp;save you from any regrets later. Now you can take the full backup of Android ROMs using two popular methods.</p>
<p>The reason why we use TWRP over other custom recoveries is the simplicity and the availability of the image file. Extracting the Boot.img file is time-consuming and requires some effort. Every smartphone brand has a unique firmware format, and the boot.img location on a firmware might also change. Many OEMs, like as Google <a href="https://www.appellawyer.com/blog/unlock-the-full-potential-of-your-sm-j327p-device/">stock firmware file</a> and Motorola, enable users to extract boot.img files straight from their firmware. However, manufacturers such as Realme and Oppo keep the Boot.img file within the OZIP file, whereas OnePlus stores the image file within payload.bin. So to fix any modding-related issues, boot your phone into TWRP, then press the &#8220;Restore&#8221; button. From here, select your backup from the list (it will be named based on the date it was created), then simply swipe the slider at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class='aligncenter' style='display: block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;' src="http://hackinformer.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/tumblr_nq1y9rnQdC1qfi5kio1_540.gif" width="305px" alt="stock rom backup apk"/></p>
<p>All you need is a computer and a device running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or newer. Remember, a full backup is not useful if it is too old, so you&#8217;ll probably need to make regular backups. When chosing option 1 or 2 it is a tradeoff between how much you value the backup vs how much hassle you are willing to put up with. Droid Explorer (v0.8.8.7+) will be able to handle this for 4.0+ devices. While Droid Explorer is currently optimized for Rooted devices, this functionality will work for non-rooted devices as well. In Windows Explorer navigate to where you installed the Android SDK and SHIFT+RIGHT CLICK on the platform-tools folder. It costs $5/month for a basic plan with no ads and limited features, or $30/year for a premium plan with no ads and unlimited features.</p>
<ul>
<li>Before we proceed to flash stock firmware using Recovery, there are some preparation steps to follow to make sure the flashing process completes smoothly.</li>
<li>If you insist on using custom recoveries, rename the Magisk APK to uninstall.zip and flash it like any other ordinary flashable zip.</li>
<li>There are certain things you need before you can start installing a custom Android ROM on your phone.</li>
<li>Before going to install Cell C Titan stock ROMÂ you need to take a backup of all your messages, photos, and apps from your smartphone.</li>
<li>For example, the Pixel 5, OnePlus 9 Pro, and Galaxy S23 Ultra have access to TWRP, thanks to the dedicated developer community.</li>
<li>This increases security and ease of mind since you can physically access and lock your files.</li>
</ul>
<p>Are we talking about the conventional memory sector state, or the fuzzier user experienced state of functionality. This isn&#8217;t a &#8220;full backup&#8221; in so far as it comes to system settings, but it does restore application settings and data. It does not backup your internal storage (the user files), so you&#8217;ll have to backup those files separately.</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you want to reset the FRP lock on MediaTek Android phones?</li>
<li>Samsung Cloud is a built-in app and feature that allows you to back up and restore your Samsung phone if it gets lost, broken, or after a factory reset.</li>
<li>Nandroid backup is necessary in order to create a secondary backup of your current stock ROM or modified ROM in any Android device.</li>
<li>Once your device is rooted, some apps like Titanium Backup can be downloaded.</li>
<li>The backup is in the form of a ZIP file with a flash-all script included inside.</li>
</ul>
<p>Google and Motorola are among the major companies that do. It&#8217;s normally possible to get factory images from Samsung and LG, but you may need to download  them from third-party sites. If  you downloaded a pre-rooted stock ROM and want to keep it that way, you&#8217;re now good to go.</p>
