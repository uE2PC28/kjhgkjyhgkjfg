										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With this stock firmware, users can only perform limited tasks that are defined by the phone’s manufacturers. For instance, users have to be on stock firmware unless or until OEM rolls out latest Android update. Now again go back, select Install and select the LazyFlasher .zip file.</p>
<p>There are 2 USB drivers available for the device, i.e., Mediatek Driver and ADB Driver. The Mediatek Driver is compatible with all the Mediatek Flash Tool, and the ADB Driver can be useful for establishing a connection between the mobile and the computer. Now go to the sp flash tool extract folder and launch it. The Xiaomi Mi 11i USB Driver is 100% safe for the Computer, laptop, and Xiaomi device. Furthermore, since the Xiaomi community officially releases the driver, it’s 100% safe &amp; secure to use on the Computer. You can also use it during the Firmware (OS) Flashing or Installing process on the device or fixing any Software-related issues. To exit the fastboot mode on your Xiaomi 11i HyperCharge 5G using the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons to highlight Reboot System Now and then press the Power button.</p>
<ul>
<li>You can also use a custom recovery for installing these ROMs, though do note that device-specific instructions may differ in that case.</li>
<li>Xiaomi 11i Hypercharge is Powered by MediaTek Dimensity 920 5G 6nm Latest Chipset.</li>
<li>The official Xiaomi update process is much more involved than custom ROMs.</li>
<li>They lack features on other custom ROMs, such as root access and theme support.</li>
<li>Mi firmware is updated every day so that the firmware of Xiaomi device is always latest and updated.</li>
</ul>
<p>Firstly, you need to download the custom ROM which you wish to flash to your smartphone. Let’s  see how to flash a custom ROM on any Android device using TWRP recovery. We hope that the above-given procedure is easy to use and successful to install Stock Firmware on the Xiaomi Redmi Pro Spreadtrum-powered. If you have any issues or queries, feel free to ask in the comments below. Then press and hold the Volume Down + Power button together to boot into Fastboot mode.</p>

<p>Xiaomi devices use MIUI OS based on Google’s Android System. We have updated the below list with the latest MIUI 11 Stock ROM for most of the devices. When the script is done, the fastboot ROM you have flashed will be installed on your device ready to boot. You don’t necessarily need Mi Flash Tool in order to flash fastboot ROMs on Xiaomi devices as there are pre-made scripts that you can simply run and be done with. From the MiFlash tool, you will need to select the folder where you extracted the ROM. Once the ROM has been selected, you must click the “refresh” button.</p>
<ul>
<li>These tools include the MIUI SDK (Software Development Kit) and the MIUI Developer Center.</li>
<li>Now, transfer the downloaded ROM to device storage.</li>
<li>Head to Xiaomi’s official product authentication page.</li>
<li>The Stock ROM can be used to re-install the Operating System (OS), if in case you are facing any Software related issue, bootloop issue, IMEI issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>This article will provide an overview of Xiaomi Stock ROM development, from custom ROMs to the official Xiaomi update process. Finally, the latest Xiaomi stock ROMs also come with various tools and apps that make using the device  even easier. Xiaomi has included several apps that allow users to get the most out of their devices, including music players, video players, photo editors, and more. These apps help to make the device even more user-friendly and make it easier for users to get the most out of their devices.</p>
